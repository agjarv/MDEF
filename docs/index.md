# Welcome

Welcome to my documentation website for my journey through the Master in Design for Emergent Futures program. I started this journey in October 2022. I was thrilled to move to Barcelona to create alongside 25 other amazing people. You can see the documentation websites for the rest of my co-hort on the [MDEF 2022-2023 Website] (https://fablabbcn.github.io/mdef-docs/academic_year_2022_23/students_websites/).
