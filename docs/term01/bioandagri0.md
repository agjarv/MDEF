# Biology and Agri Zero

In the rural schools of the small towns I grew up in the high school and elementary students were combined in one building. When I was in first grade some high schoolers came into our classroom to teach us a little about biology and to do an experiment with us. They brought us little round dishes of jelly for us to rub our hands in order to grow the "germs" on our hands. After a few days the dishes of jelly started to grow and turned all sorts of amazing colors. I was absolutely blown away by the "magic". They showed us that we have microorganisms living on our hands and body. The exercise that was definitely meant to teach us about hand washing taught me about the universes we have living around and on us and probably actually resulted in my first grade self not wanting to wash her hands for a while. 

About a year later my mother married my stepfather and we moved to their farm. I spent the rest of my childhood getting my hands dirty while helping the family raise cattle and grow wheat and sorghum. This sort of labor is hard work and I never dreamed of doing it for the rest of my life. I was essentially counting down the days until I graduated high school and could move as far away from farming life as possible. When I got older and moved to a city outside DC I met lots of friends who had spent most of their lives in the suburbs or urban life and they shared with me their dreams of growing their own food. At first I  found this to be pretty amusing then I realized that there is something very inhumane about being disconnected from our food. I think we want to be connected.... and the more connected we are the better it is for us and everything around us. 

During these weeks on Biology and Agri Zero I am interested in exploring the micro and macro. The microscopic world around us offers so many possibilities for taking care of ourselves and the environment around us. I also want to think about the big systems and technologies we use to produce our food. I believe more of us need to get our hands dirty together to find scalable technologies to feed the planet. 


## Bio Lab Notes

On the first day we learned about DIY Biology and Biohacking. I learned that a lot of expensive lab equipment can be recreated for a fraction of the cost in a DIY lab or makerspace. Our instructor for the week, Nuria Conde, also showed us some possibilities for portable DIY bio-lab equipment that can be taken into the field for forest. We were given recipes got to prepare different growing mediums(??) for yeast and bacteria. My group received the following recipe to prepare petri dishes to grow yeast. 

> **DIY Yeast Medium** for 1000ml
> 
> 10 grams Bovril
> 20 grams Amino Acids to build up muscle
> 5 grams sugar
> 20 grams agar
