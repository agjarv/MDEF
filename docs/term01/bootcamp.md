# MDEF Bootcamp

The first term started in October 2022. In this first week we were introduced to our instructors, classmates, and potential collaborators. We were also introduced to spaces at IAAC, Elisava, and around El Poblenou neighborhood where we will be working in this term. We learned how to set up our documentation websites and were given a few assignments to introduce ourselves to the group and start learning more about who we are and what we would like to get from the courses. 

## What is my fight? 

For our first assignment we were asked to identify an issue, concern, cause or particular interest that we felt strongly about. From this idea we were asked to create a poster and bring it to the first day of class.
