# Research Trip in El Hierro, Canary Islands  

## Reflections  

During our research trip to El Hierro in the Canary Islands, Jordan, Marielle, and I explored the concept of Broken Translations. While on the island, we had the opportunity to learn about present-day agricultural practices, culture, and sustainable energy. However, one aspect that was noticeably missing was the voices of the original indigenous people of the island. We discussed how our learnings would be a "broken translation" of what the original people might have known.

Throughout the week, we collected various forms of media, including thoughts, images, videos, poetry, and music, from the plants on the island. To capture the music from the plants, I used a device that Jordan and I had developed in collaboration over the past few months for our design interventions. The device is based on an open-source project by Sam Cusumano.

I created a video compilation of all the sounds recorded from the plants on the island. At the beginning of the video, you'll see me connecting the sensor to myself to collect music and create the background rhythm that plays throughout the video. Overall, our research trip to El Hierro provided valuable insights into the concept of Broken Translations and inspired us to continue exploring how to bridge gaps in our understanding of different cultures and histories.
