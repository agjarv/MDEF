# Design Ethics

## Reflection

During this course, I gained a new perspective on the definition of technology. I learned that technology encompasses more than just "high tech" devices like iPhones; it also includes things like monoculture. I found it intriguing that technology is not neutral but rather a reflection of what a society, community, or powerful group values as positive. Similarly, design is never neutral and is intended to influence behavior in a particular way.

One concept that stood out to me was Care Ethics. I appreciated the idea that an individual's wellbeing is closely tied to the social context and community they belong to. It's common for people to hold individuals accountable for their own wellbeing without considering how the environment around them impacts their health. By adopting the principles of Care Ethics, we can design environments and systems that support wellbeing for everyone.

Lastly, I found the discussions on professional ethics to be applicable to my own design practice. The idea that everyone is a designer, and that the professional designer is not superior to anyone else, was particularly inspiring. I learned that professions are moral projects, and as a professional designer, I have the power to transform my thinking from "caring about" to "caring for."
