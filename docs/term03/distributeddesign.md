## Day 1 - Mushroom Model Exercise

*Learning Skills
What skills did I need during this activity and how can I translate into something useful for me and my future?*  

This exercise mostly required communication and listening skills. I think it is always useful to listen more than you talk when working in a group setting.  

*Dynamic
How was the dynamic inside the group?*  

In our group of four it seemed like three people had an easy time sharing but one person was speaking up less. I tried to ask them questions to prompt them to talk more. Everyone was respectful of each other and gave room for everyone to share their ideas.  

*Interactions
Did the role I play influence my opinion?*  

I was the one who stayed at our table and represented our group in talking about our mushroom model. I don’t really think the role I played changed my opinion about anything so much. It was nice to get feedback from the other groups directly about our model. I enjoy that more than giving feedback. 

## Day 2 - Reflection Tree and Group Reflection  

*Learning Skills
What skills did I need during this activity and how can I translate into something useful for me and my future?*  

This exercise triggered a lot of communication and collaboration with one of my collaborators I am working with. We decided to do the exercise based on our joint intervention. We learned a lot and found that this tool might be useful for us in the future projects as well.  

*Dynamic
How was the dynamic inside the group?*  

Our group had three people and two of us were working assessing the same project. I was worried that the third person might feel out of the loop when we came together to discuss since they were assessing a different intervention. I didn’t want them to feel left out. For the larger class reflection we brought another small group into our group and that was better.  

*Interactions
Did the role I play influence my opinion?*  

I don’t think the role I played influenced my opinion on anything. Looking at the reflection tree at first it was overwhelming but when I started going through the exercise I understood it pretty easily and found it pretty useful.  

## Day 3 - Value Presentation  

*Learning Skills
What skills did I need during this activity and how can I translate into something useful for me and my future?*  

In this activity I used a lot of communication skills and listening as in the previous activities. I think our group was also creative with our interpretation with how to do the exercise. We used it as an opportunity to focus on the process and the conversation rather than just the final outcome. You don’t always get to focus on just the process in every situation but it is nice to do that where there are opportunities.  

*Dynamic
How was the dynamic inside the group?*  

I think our group worked very well together. We all got to take part in the conversation and process some feelings about our topic. I think everyone learned something from each other. We also brought a person into our group who arrived later and they added some great stuff to the conversation and presentation as well.   

*Interactions
Did the role I play influence my opinion?*  

I think I played the same role as everyone else in this activity. I don’t think it influenced my opinion.
