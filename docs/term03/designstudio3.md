# Design Studio Term 03

## Framing First Design Intervention

After the feedback from Design Dialogues after term two I realized that I want to continue working on this idea of crafting communities. Sam and I want to continue offering opportunities for people to gather around making and focusing on upcycling and reusing things we already have. I want to keep working on the open source tools and see how they can be used to tackle textile waste. I also want to explore how to build a community around craft and regenerative practices in fashion. Here are the first ideas for going forward this term.  

- Host UFO nights (Unfinished Objects) where people are invited to bring projects that have been started but haven’t had time to finish.  
- Host clothing repair workshops where people are invited to bring their own clothes to learn how to repair them by hand.  
- Workshops on using open source tools made in the makerspace and inviting people to participate in “crafts in the lab”
- Host a community dye back where people can bring their old clothes and dye them together to extend the life of the clothes they already own.  
-  Contact clothing recycling centers to find materials to be used in reutilization and upcycling efforts.  

I also want to try and incorporate my learnings from the microbial and other non-human communities to see how it can be applied in organizing crafting communities around a cause or purpose. I am wondering how I can create an environment that invites diversity where I and others flourish. Sami and I got together and made a collective design space for these ideas that we plan to start working on this term.

## Alternative presents to Emergent Futures

In the previous term Sami and I envisioned an alternative present where people are empowered to create things themselves rather than relying on an exploitative system. We want to create a space where people can slow down and make together, combating 
isolation, perfectionism, and honoring traditional methods of making. With our final intervention, *Our Blueprint: Crafting Futures Together,* the aim is to teach and empower people to create and transform their own clothes, shaping a more sustainable future together. The present fashion system exploits people and causes massive destruction to the planet. The current role of the designer in the fashion system is top down – the designer works with corporations to determine and dictate what people wear around the world. I would like to see a change where we move toward a model where everyone participates more directly in expressing themselves through what they wear. The role of the designer can be to facilitate this self expression of others through education and guiding people to have the skills they need to express themselves. The designer can also serve as a connector - connecting the broken parts of the fashion systems that can transform it into something that is less exploitative and works for more people. We believe that making together as a community has the power to start making this vision a reality.  

In this intervention we want to invite people to explore this idea of “Future Heirlooms”. We are asking what sort of clothing items would people like to pass on to future generations. Currently we are adding immense amounts of clothing to landfills that will be there for generations to come. These are the things we are currently giving to future generations. We want to spark a discussion about how we can change that by creating, crafting, and loving our clothes. We want to know what such a future would look like to other people. I believe that taking a role as a facilitator in discussions around the future and including everyone is the type of role I can have as a designer, allowing others to design and shape the future through what they wear.
