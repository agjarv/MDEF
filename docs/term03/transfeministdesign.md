# Critical Transfeminist Design  

The Critical Transfeminist Design course, led by Laura Benitez, proved to be a highlight of this term, offering a deeply philosophical perspective compared to our other courses. Laura introduced us to the concept of transfeminism as a counter to transhumanism, emphasizing the importance of challenging hegemonic structures and exploring the notion of the subaltern (self) as a foundation for understanding power dynamics. Through thought-provoking discussions, we came to recognize that what may be utopia for one person can be dystopia for another.  

Epistemic violence was a key topic we explored, unveiling the significance of absences and omissions in knowledge systems. We questioned the existence of universal rules and methodologies, acknowledging that the research methodologies, academic systems, and disciplines we encounter are products of human creation by a less inclusive group of individuals and institutions. They do not represent the diverse voices and perspectives that exist worldwide, and we should regard them as merely one way of knowing. Our focus should shift from what is known to how knowledge is constructed.  

One statement by Laura resonated deeply with me: "There is nothing more authoritarian than 'giving a voice' to and imposing an identity upon others." This remark compelled us to critically examine our own actions and resist the reproduction, recreation, or reinforcement of oppressive structures. We must remain mindful of the act of categorization, which can be seen as a form of colonialism. Additionally, we must be attentive to the intended audience of our research and question who benefits from our work.  

The Critical Transfeminist Design course provided me with profound insights and called for a critical examination of power dynamics, knowledge construction, and the reproduction of oppressive structures. It encouraged me to approach design from a more inclusive and transformative perspective, embracing diverse voices and challenging the prevailing norms and systems that govern our practice.  


Laura also shared many fantastic queer, transfeminist, and feminist creative projects and designers that were really inspiring.   

## Design Justice Principles  

Laura also introduced us to the design justice principles that we were also introduced to in Future Talks and other courses. I wanted to include them here for my future reference. 

From [Design Justice Network](https://designjustice.org/read-the-principles)  

1. We use design to sustain, heal, and empower our communities, as well as to seek liberation from exploitative and oppressive systems.  
2. We center the voices of those who are directly impacted by the outcomes of the design process.  
3. We prioritize designâ€™s impact on the community over the intentions of the designer.  
4. We view change as emergent from an accountable, accessible, and collaborative process, rather than as a point at the end of a process.  
5. We see the role of the designer as a facilitator rather than an expert.  
6. We believe that everyone is an expert based on their own lived experience, and that we all have unique and brilliant contributions to bring to a design process.  
7. We share design knowledge and tools with our communities.  
8. We work towards sustainable, community-led and -controlled outcomes.  
9. We work towards non-exploitative solutions that reconnect us to the earth and to each other.  
10. Before seeking new design solutions, we look for what is already working at the community level. We honor and uplift traditional, indigenous, and local knowledge and practices.
