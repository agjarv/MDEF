# Digital Prototyping for Design: Part II

## Wildcard - Robots

For this class we got to learn how to control a robotic arm with Grasshopper and simulate the movements in Rhino. Josep demonstrated on how to install the library for the robotic arm and how to use a Grasshopper example sketch to get the robot to "write letters". I was able to install it on my computer and try out the simulation. It was pretty easy to install and get started moving the robot arm in the Rhino/Grasshopper simulation.

In the lab Josep attached an LED to the robot so the robot could do "light writing". Using a timelapse camera we were able to capture the LED light tracing based on the robot's movements to get some cool light art. This was really fun and I was surprised how easy it was to control this robot even though it looks very complicated.
