## Reframing and Reflecting from Term 1

![Design Space Term 2](..images/term-02/ds2/Design-Space-Term-2-signals.jpeg)

At the beginning of this term I have not really narrowed down the number of weak signals I am interested in. Instead I have replaced some of the ones from term 1 with new weak signals and triggers. One of the main ones I want to note is the addition of Interspecies Collaboration. After the Plant Band intervention I realized there are more opportunities to use this technology to interface with other species. I want to take the opportunity this term to explore soil ecologies and the "life underground". I plan to do this by collecting and cultivating indigenous microbes from the forest and learning from them.
I want to continue to explore more tools to interface between life and technology. Before coming to MDEF I designed several interfaces that explored alternative ways for humans to interface with computers. Most of these were in the form of wearable or interactive musical MIDI devices. I am really excited to expand my knowledge of these tools beyond just a human focus and start working with other species. In relation to this I created a new random trigger card called Data Sonification. I think Data Sonification in the Plant Band intervention example provides a way to make something like the biological processes of a plant more interesting and accessible to non-scientists and future scientists.
The Plant Band event is planned for January 22nd. As a result of some conversations I had before and during the Design Dialogues I am thinking of ways where the children can collaborate more with the plants. Rather than using them as instruments I think it could be more meaningful interspecies collaboration if the children were able to add their own biological music to join in with the band as they are playing. I am sure we will get a lot of valuable feedback from the parents and kids at the event. That being said I am not sure if our group is as interested to continue working with children going forward. One of the key takeaways from the planning process of this intervention so far has been to be open to the needs of the community. We might approach a community with ideas on how to intervene but it is best to be open and flexible to adjust to the needs of the community. We don't need to bring ideas but rather a set of skills. One of the benefits of being creative is that there is usually no shortage of ideas and therefore no need to approach a community with so many pre-made ideas and solutions.
In the first term I also learned that not every critique means I need to change direction completely. Sometimes it might mean I just need to work on how I am communicating my ideas. I didn't agree with some of the feedback I received on the Climate Grief intervention from last term. A few people had some issues with the focus on the word grief and were concerned that "dwelling in grief" could lead to inaction. I think it is important to make space for difficult feelings and topics within a community working on tackling ecological challenges. At the end of last term I resolved to try and work on my execution and communication on the importance of addressing anger and grief within our community spaces. At the beginning of term 2 we had a course on Designing for the Next Billion Seconds. This week I was introduced to the concept of Critical Hope (Kari Grain 2022). I read the introduction to her book and think she beautifully frames my perspective on this. It was really validating to read and I am looking forward to exploring this concept of critical hope further this term. I think ultimately if I stick to my values and learn to communicate them better then I am on the right track.
The Climate Grief workshop was part of a larger project proposed by my collaborator, Paige. She plans to propose an exhibition of a series of resilient species encased in resin placed around Barcelona. The artifacts are part of an educational sort of scavenger hunt that speculates about how the species will be useful in the Post-Mediterranean climate of a future Barcelona. She imagined that the information encased in the resin was placed there by an interspecies collaboration collective. After our workshop I suggested that we explore further what such a collective would look like if we started forming it today. This term Paige and I plan to start exploring this concept as well as the practical steps to actually encasing these species in resin for the exhibition.
My final learning point from the last term is to start earlier! Once I have an idea I just need to get going instead of spending so much time in the planning phase. When I took art classes I found this kind of exploration coming more naturally to me. My former sculpture teacher would always say "work makes work". When studying design there has typically been more research and planning but sometimes I can get stuck there. I would like to find a balance between the two disciplines. Overall I am very excited to start working exploring my new weak signals, learning new tools to interface with the world, and researching new concepts to help me communicate my ideas more clearly.

### Next Interventions
My first interventions will be related to exploring soil ecologies as mentioned above. For the first step I will collect soil microbes from the forest according to the Jadam natural farming practices that I researched last term. That process will take at least 10 days. In the second phase I will start listening to the soil microbes with an interface similar to the one built for the Plant Band intervention. I not exactly sure what I will learn form doing this but I know I'll learn something as I go through this process.
