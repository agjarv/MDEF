# Communicating Ideas

I am Amanda Jarvis -- Citizen of Earth, Designer, Maker, Lifelong Beginner of Things. 

## Purpose 

My purpose is to leverage my expertise and influence to amplify the voices of others, both human and non-human.

## Vision 

My vision is a world where people are empowered to create and produce things themselves, rather than relying on an exploitative system.

## Mission

My mission is to offer glimpses of alternative futures by enabling others to learn new skills and create things for themselves.

## Values

**Community over individualism:** I believe in the importance of prioritizing the needs and well-being of the community over individual desires or gains.

**Humility:** I recognize the limitations of my own knowledge and expertise, and approach all interactions with a spirit of openness and willingness to learn.

**Embracing the unknown:** I see the value in exploring new and unfamiliar territories, and embrace the potential for growth and learning that comes with stepping outside of my comfort zone.

**Letting go and adapting:** I understand that change is inevitable and that the ability to adapt and let go of old ways of thinking or doing things is critical to growth and progress.

## Research Statement

My research focuses on exploring the relationship between craft, land, and technology. Specifically, I am interested in examining how craft can serve as an interface to the land and how it can facilitate exploration of the natural world through technology. One of my main objectives is to identify parallels between cultivating microbial communities and fostering inclusive creative communities. By creating a space for slowing down and breaking down the boundaries between human and non-human, my research seeks to promote a more holistic understanding of the world around us.
