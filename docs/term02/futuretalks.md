# Future Talks

Future Talks was a captivating series of lectures during this term, featuring various designers and artists who delved into compelling topics such as autobiographical design, autoethnographic research, design justice, and crafting within community and local resources. Audrey Desjardines kicked off the discussions by sharing her experience of "living in a prototype" through inhabiting and renovating a van simultaneously. She eloquently described her emergent prototyping process and highlighted her documentation journey on Instructables, where she connected with an online community.

Laura Forlano, in her thought-provoking presentation, explored the realm of auto-ethnography and discussed her personal experience as a disabled cyborg. She delved into her authentic and first-person research concerning her relationship with diabetes, disability, and technology, referring to herself as a disabled cyborg. She reflected on the profound meaning of being connected to a machine and raised intriguing questions about how machines themselves can be disabled. Additionally, Laura emphasized the role of internet communities in fostering connections and facilitating conversations about rare diseases and medical issues.

Fred Van Amstel shared his exploration of Monster Aesthetics, delving into the impact of colonization on our bodies and its far-reaching influence on design and political landscapes. He introduced the principles of design justice, advocating for a profound reevaluation of design processes that center the voices and experiences of those who are typically marginalized. By embracing collaborative and creative practices, these principles offer a transformative approach to addressing the most pressing challenges faced by our communities.

In another inspiring presentation, Julia Ballesteros and Milena Ros√©s shared their work centered around returning to their hometown and engaging in ceramics creation. They highlighted the significance of collecting natural clay from the local land, which required collaboration with older generations who possessed invaluable knowledge of the area's landscapes. This emphasis on respecting and integrating multigenerational knowledge underscored the depth and richness of their creative process.

Overall, the Future Talks series provided us with a diverse range of perspectives and insights, opening up new horizons for exploration and sparking meaningful discussions about the intersection of design, personal experiences, community, and the utilization of local resources.


## Updated Vision and Identity

Throughout term II, my research has revolved around the intersection of craft, land, and technology. I have delved into the potential of craft as a means to connect with the land and explore the natural world through the lens of technology. One of my key goals has been to draw parallels between cultivating microbial communities and fostering inclusive creative communities. By breaking down barriers between humans and non-humans, I aim to cultivate a holistic understanding of our surroundings and create spaces for introspection and connection.  

As my journey progressed, my vision remained unwavering, but I began to refine my role within that vision. As a designer, I aspire to leverage my expertise and influence to amplify the voices of others, both human and non-human. I envision a world where individuals are empowered to take charge of their own creation and production processes, rather than being reliant on an exploitative system. By imparting new skills and facilitating self-sufficiency, I aim to offer glimpses of alternative futures.  

One significant realization I had was the importance of cultivating multigenerational creative spaces. There is immense value in learning from individuals who have deep connections to the land and possess diverse life experiences. While this may seem obvious, it is crucial to consciously include voices from all generations within these spaces. Furthermore, embracing the wisdom and perspectives of non-human collaborators adds richness and depth to our collective understanding.  

I have also pondered the concept of makerspaces and the significance of prioritizing community and skills over physical space. A room filled with tools holds little meaning without the people who bring it to life. Additionally, I have recognized the profound impact of online platforms and spaces in fostering connections among individuals. The internet serves as a powerful tool for uniting communities around common causes and shared struggles. Hence, it is vital to accord online spaces the same importance as physical spaces when nurturing creative communities.  

 By integrating these insights into my work, I aim to establish inclusive spaces that honor diverse voices, foster intergenerational exchange, and utilize both physical and virtual platforms to create a robust network of creative communities.
