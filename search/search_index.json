At this point I was able to start grouping the weak signals in clusters with some of the other cards.

This connects most closely to my personal connection to making. I have a background making clothing and costumes since I was about 9 years old. Later when I studied costume design I started to think of everything we wear as a costume and a means of communicating things to others. When we learn about \"costume\" in the historical context it is referring to what people were wearing in a certain time and the cultural norms of dress. In the past people were communicating the highest forms craft, wealth and power of their age in their cultural dress. I like to think the significance of the current moment, where we are adding the most dense technology to the body that humans have ever created, will not go unnoticed by future costume historians. What will they think of what we are wearing now? I am interested in the spaces where craft bumps up against technology. Where does technology replace craft? Can technology become craft?

When thinking about my own experience with learning about costume history (or any history) I realize that there is so much left out of the story. The things that are left behind are  the smallest representation of the people who lived at any given time. Those (institutions) with the most wealth and power decide what is culturally significant enough to be preserved and studied. Additionally entire cultures were wiped out and archived in the basements of museums held by the very powers that destroyed them. Earlier this year I worked on my Fabricademy final project where I explored a fictional, solarpunk future where important cultural information is passed through oral tradition in the form of poetry and dress. Going forward I would like to continue explore ideas on what is preserved, what gets re-told, and alternative methodologies to western academic forms of transmission.  </p>"},{"location":"term01/bioandagri0/","title":"Biology and Agri Zero","text":"<p>In the rural schools of the small towns I grew up in the high school and elementary students were combined in one building. When I was in first grade some high schoolers came into our classroom to teach us a little about biology and to do an experiment with us. They brought us little round dishes of jelly for us to rub our hands in order to grow the \"germs\" on our hands. After a few days the dishes of jelly started to grow and turned all sorts of amazing colors. I was absolutely blown away by the \"magic\". They showed us that we have microorganisms living on our hands and body. The exercise that was definitely meant to teach us about hand washing taught me about the universes we have living around and on us and probably actually resulted in my first grade self not wanting to wash her hands for a while. </p> <p>About a year later my mother married my stepfather and we moved to their farm. I spent the rest of my childhood getting my hands dirty while helping the family raise cattle and grow wheat and sorghum. This sort of labor is hard work and I never dreamed of doing it for the rest of my life. I was essentially counting down the days until I graduated high school and could move as far away from farming life as possible. When I got older and moved to a city outside DC I met lots of friends who had spent most of their lives in the suburbs or urban life and they shared with me their dreams of growing their own food. At first I  found this to be pretty amusing then I realized that there is something very inhumane about being disconnected from our food. I think we want to be connected.... and the more connected we are the better it is for us and everything around us. </p> <p>This week I got to explore the micro and macro. The microscopic world around us offers so many possibilities for taking care of ourselves and the environment around us. I have been thinking about the big systems and technologies we use to produce our food. We were asked to select a couple photos from the week as a reflection. I made a collage of some of the hands and my classmates and myself getting our hands dirty over the last two weeks. </p> <p></p>"},{"location":"term01/bioandagri0/#bio-lab-notes","title":"Bio Lab Notes","text":"<p>On the first day we learned about DIY Biology and Biohacking.

I have always wondered how practices like this could be scaled up to the sort of farming my parents practice. I asked Jonathan about this and mentioned that right now there aren't great ways to scale permaculture up for large grain crops. After some discussion with him he mentioned that we need to be adding complexity. I am now wondering if I have been asking the wrong questions about scale. In our culture we always want to know how to scale \u2014 grow \u2014 profit. So it comes natural for me to ask questions like this. How do we scale it up? But maybe we shouldn\u2019t be scaling as all. The focus should be on adding or embracing complexity and diversity.</p> <p>Beekeeping is also something I have been interested in trying since I got into permaculture but never had the opportunity to do. As part of my permacultural explorations in past years I came across some possible complications of keeping honeybees as they might potentially threaten native bee populations. This week I found a recent article in Scientific American on \"The Problem with Honey Bees\". In this article author Alison McAfee, a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Entomology and Plant Pathology, at North Carolina State University, suggests that introduction of honeybee hives in an ecosystem reduces the amount of forage left available for native solitary bee populations and other pollinators. This could have an overall negative impact of biodiversity in the ecosystem. McAffee also mentioned that measuring the interactions of honeybees in a new ecosystem is a tricky thing to research as many parts of the world have already had honeybees introduced by human intervention. To explore this further I consulted an article published in 2019 in Nature titled \"Honeybees disrupt the structure and functionality of plant-pollinator networks\". where researchers studied honeybees in the Canary Islands. These bees are removed seasonally so the researchers were able to study the impact bringing in honeybees have on the native bee population by looking at the nestedness and modularity of the native bees. In as little as one day after bringing in honeybees the researchers saw a decline in the pollen and nectar available to the native bees. In the first article McAfee goes on to mention that honeybees do not out-compete native species in all cases. It seems to depend on many different factors like what plants are available and which native bee species live in an ecosystem. I think in the end it is important to keep all of this in mind when thinking about protecting pollinators and conservation of natural habitats. Everything is so connected and it is important to look at things in context of their ecosystem rather than broadly applying something like beneficial insects or other technological solutions that work for one ecosystem because it might not work the same way in the next. </p>"},{"location":"term01/bootcamp/","title":"MDEF Bootcamp","text":"<p>The first term started in October 2022.

Huge issues like climate change can be overwhelming the more I learn about all the ways it connects with our daily lives.

Both of these approaches are really tough to stick to long term and I didn't really feel like they made a much of a difference addressing the huge issues anyway. When I started working at my university makerspace I had the realization that a lot of these issues must be addressed collectively and the makerspace was one outlet to do so.

Each month Stephy's collaborates with Mamas in Biz to put on a pop-up market for a group of local, women-led small businesses. </p> <p>Context:  An idea for this design intervention came out of exploring the ideas and questions around how kids interpret nature. We are interested in learning more about how kids connect with nature. Our collaborator, Jordan Hodges, who recently moved to barcelona is going to be a father soon. Ultimately Jordan is hoping to raise his child in a way that is connected to nature. I am also interested in education and exploring different ways to interact with nature. When Jordan arrived to Barcelona he connected with a network of parents and care providers around Barcelona. One of these providers is Stephy's.  </p> <p>Current Situation:  When Jordan met Stephy he mentioned that we were graduate students looking to do educational interventions for kids. We met with Stephy again and proposed an idea to host a concert put on by plants for kids. She liked the idea and gave us some feedback on the structure and facilitation of the event. She helped us determine whether or not to structure it as a workshop or an event. She invited us to be the \"entertainment\" at an upcoming pop-up market event. The expectation is that lots of parents and their kids will attend the market and there will be opportunity for the kids to interact with the \"Plant Band\". </p> <p>Engagement and Limits: Since the event is informal we expect to be interacting with people from all different age ranges. People will be coming and going throughout the day. If we had framed it as a workshop we could limit it to a specific age range to work with. I also expect that we will receive a lot of feedback and information on how to improve our intervention. I have done a few interactive exhibitions for kids in the past and I always find that there are surprises in how they interact that are never expected. This information is always pretty valuable and useful when doing future engagements. We will also have the opportunity to interact with both the kids and their parents at the same time which I think could be valuable. </p> <p>Theory of Change: At this point I think we will mostly be learning from the kids and their parents. We hope that this interaction with the plants during this event will perhaps spark some conversations between the parents and their kids about nature. Ultimately we hope to learn enough so that we can start designing educational interventions for kids to connect deeply with nature. </p> <p>Design Challenges and Opportunities: When we initially started thinking about the intervention we wanted to frame it more as a workshop where the kids would have the opportunity to listen to the plants and then be invited to tell a story based on what the plants are \"singing\". Our collaborator, Marielle, has experience doing workshops with kids and will design stickers for the kids to use in a storytelling exercise. Since we will be interacting with different age ranges for the pop-up event this activity will not be suited for all ages. I think we will gain some really useful information from this first intervention to design future interventions that are more structured and educational. </p>"},{"location":"term01/designstudio1/","title":"Design Studio","text":""},{"location":"term01/designstudio1/#roles-of-prototyping","title":"Roles of Prototyping","text":"<p>For our first design studio we learned about the roles of prototyping in design research. We were introduced to four different roles and asked to reflect which types of prototyping we have used in our deign processes and which ones we are interested in exploring further. </p> <p>The four roles of prototyping were defined as: </p> <ol> <li> <p>Prototyping for experiments to test a hypothesis. </p> </li> <li> <p>Prototyping as an instrument for inquiry. </p> </li> <li> <p>Prototypes as a research archetype. </p> </li> <li> <p>Process of prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry. </p> </li> </ol> <p>The first things that came to mind for me was when I use prototyping is in projects when I am testing new shapes or materials I have never used before. In the first case have used prototypes when designing and building costumes for theater or other performance. I have built prototypes to test movement for the performer in materials that can be rapidly put together for less cost than the final costume. This form of prototyping is primarily used as \"hypothesis\" validation in my process. I have an idea or desired outcome that I want to test before completing the final product. </p> <p>The second main way I use prototypes is when I test new materials that I have never used before for a new application other than what they are intended for. When building wearable technology where is a lot for me to learn about the materials newer to me (electronic components) as I am integrating them into textiles. This often requires me to explore the materials and how they work together before I can build them into a project. In this case I use prototyping as an instrument to explore the materials and learn more abut them. </p> <p>The last two roles of prototyping I have used less but I have thought of using both of them in different ways. I like the idea of using prototypes as a tool for critical design as part of my research practice. I have envisioned several projects like this I would like to try but I haven't had as many opportunities to build them.  </p> <p>Using prototypes as a vehicle for inquiry is also very appealing to me as well. One project that I think uses this form of prototyping very well is and have mentioned on this blog previously is The Embroidered Computer by Irene Posch. I really admire how they explore the intersection between traditional crafts and technology. I would be interested in participating in large collaborative design research projects like this in the future.

I found these discussions to be the most interesting part of this course. When presenting our final group projects we discussed some problems that could result from each final group project. We discussed claims of accuracy and how the systems are only as good as the data going in to them. We learned that the AI systems can produce false positives, true positives, false negatives and true negatives. More ethical issues arise when outsourcing decisions to AI. Again, here the system is only as good as the date going into it. The AI will make assumptions based on the dominant culture. This can be problematic because those who engineering the machine decide what is socially acceptable in their own culture and may not account for the variations from culture to culture. This results in their biases being \"baked\" into the machine from the start. Going deeper into this we also discussed how these biases created by the \"dominant culture\" can be inclusive or exclusive of those who are divergent from the datasets. This could actually create a feedback loop that can further exclude people that are already marginalized in society. Another point we discussed is the access of private and biometric data that is collected from users. We discussed concerned of privacy around these digital profiles and how it is collected, bought, and sold often without the knowledge of the users of the system. Companies in turn make profits off this data. We also discussed concerns around how this private data could eventually be used against the users if privacy is not protected. Lastly we discussed how some problems facing us today might not all require high tech solutions such as AI. Some problems are more complex and require more nuanced, gentle care to solve than what machines and artificial intelligence can provide. </p>"},{"location":"term01/extendedintelligences/#group-project-diyosaurus","title":"Group Project: DIYosaurus","text":"<p>Our group imagined a system that takes photos of an object as input and generates and outputs instructions on how to build the object.

And why did it matter?</p> <p>I decided to wear some of my health data \"on the outside\" for 24 hours. I had recently been struggling with sleep and downloaded an app on my phone for tracking sleep. I began reflecting on all the sleep and health apps I have on my phone already. I have had an interest in wearables and always enjoy downloading apps for my smart watch that I end up forgetting about after a short time. When I stop using the apps they are still sitting there collecting my data. I started wondering what happens to all of that information. I have also has some health struggles over the last year. I also started wondering if these apps can honestly give a real picture of the health of a person. All this information is collected but they don't really give me any answers on what is really going on. For this first person research experiment I wanted to explore this health data that my phone collects more deeply. I chose a few different data points and wrote them on a piece of cloth and attached it to my clothes. </p> <p>What happens when you involve yourself?</p> <p>Since this experiment was deeply personal it really only made sense to me with my personal data. I shared personal information with the world and also experienced something that day that no one else did in exactly the same way. It made me think more about the boundaries between my body, my data, and others. Those boundaries were made more physical by bringing the data out of my phone and physically displaying it on my body. I became way  more self conscious about the outside of my body that day and was probably way more concerned about it  than  anyone else.  </p> <p>What happens when you use yourself as an instrument?</p> <p>There was something both vulnerable and freeing about working this way. One one hand, as mentioned in the section above, I tend to spend a lot of time planning things and self-editing my ideas before I get to work on something that is a school or work related project. It was freeing to just try something out on myself because it is low stakes when it is just myself. On the other hand it still required me to be vulnerable by just doing something without thinking too much about it. </p> <p>Did anything change about your way of working?</p> <p>I think there is value in just quickly trying something yourself. I tend to overthink and imagine things a lot before I start on something. This experiment required me to just go for something without thinking too much about it since I only had 24 hours. I definitely ended up doing something I wouldn't normally do.</p> <p>What does it mean for your future work?</p> <p>I never really thought my personal experiences or opinions were all that important when thinking about research. Sometimes it is scary to put something so personal out into the world especially if I am not an expert on something. I was definitely inspired this week to do my own first-person research experiments in  the future. </p> <p>After seeing the videos of your design space collective, how does it change your understanding of it, present new opportunities or inspire new possibilities for collaboration?</p> <p>It was definitely interesting to see what everyone else was doing.

The full version of the forensic report can be found right here. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The next week we started to explore what components inside the monitor could be reused or recycled.

More details on the outcome and design of the project can be found below. </p> <p>This project was overall very fun for me. In the past I have had the opportunity and curiosity to take apart electronics to see how they worked and used them in artwork and sculpture. I had also independently used Arduino and other microelectronics for other projects. Before this class I had never reused parts from old electronics in this way by combining and controlling them with Arduino. It was also really fun to work with a group and let the materials we found inside inform what our project this week would look like and perform like. After this week I am definitely more interested in resurrecting and reanimating old electronics and parts to make new things and use in my art and design work. I have also been inspired to learn more about electrical engineering to understand better how I can use some of the other components we found inside.

Instead I have replaced some of the ones from term 1 with new weak signals and triggers. One of the main ones I want to note is the addition of Interspecies Collaboration. After the Plant Band intervention I realized there are more opportunities to use this technology to interface with other species. I want to take the opportunity this term to explore soil ecologies and the \"life underground\". I plan to do this by collecting and cultivating indigenous microbes from the forest and learning from them.</p> <p>I want to continue to explore more tools to interface between life and technology. Before coming to MDEF I designed several interfaces that explored alternative ways for humans to interface with computers. Most of these were in the form of wearable or interactive musical MIDI devices. I am really excited to expand my knowledge of these tools beyond just a human focus and start working with other species. In relation to this I created a new random trigger card called Data Sonification. I think Data Sonification in the Plant Band intervention example provides a way to make something like the biological processes of a plant more interesting and accessible to non-scientists and future scientists.</p> <p>The Plant Band event is planned for January 22nd. As a result of some conversations I had before and during the Design Dialogues I am thinking of ways where the children can collaborate more with the plants. Rather than using them as instruments I think it could be more meaningful interspecies collaboration if the children were able to add their own biological music to join in with the band as they are playing. I am sure we will get a lot of valuable feedback from the parents and kids at the event. That being said I am not sure if our group is as interested to continue working with children going forward. One of the key takeaways from the planning process of this intervention so far has been to be open to the needs of the community. We might approach a community with ideas on how to intervene but it is best to be open and flexible to adjust to the needs of the community. We don't need to bring ideas but rather a set of skills. One of the benefits of being creative is that there is usually no shortage of ideas and therefore no need to approach a community with so many pre-made ideas and solutions.</p> <p>In the first term I also learned that not every critique means I need to change direction completely. Sometimes it might mean I just need to work on how I am communicating my ideas. I didn't agree with some of the feedback I received on the Climate Grief intervention from last term. A few people had some issues with the focus on the word grief and were concerned that \"dwelling in grief\" could lead to inaction. I think it is important to make space for difficult feelings and topics within a community working on tackling ecological challenges. At the end of last term I resolved to try and work on my execution and communication on the importance of addressing anger and grief within our community spaces. At the beginning of term 2 we had a course on Designing for the Next Billion Seconds. This week I was introduced to the concept of Critical Hope (Kari Grain 2022). I read the introduction to her book and think she beautifully frames my perspective on this. It was really validating to read and I am looking forward to exploring this concept of critical hope further this term. I think ultimately if I stick to my values and learn to communicate them better then I am on the right track.</p> <p>The Climate Grief workshop was part of a larger project proposed by my collaborator, Paige. She plans to propose an exhibition of a series of resilient species encased in resin placed around Barcelona. The artifacts are part of an educational sort of scavenger hunt that speculates about how the species will be useful in the Post-Mediterranean climate of a future Barcelona. She imagined that the information encased in the resin was placed there by an interspecies collaboration collective. After our workshop I suggested that we explore further what such a collective would look like if we started forming it today. This term Paige and I plan to start exploring this concept as well as the practical steps to actually encasing these species in resin for the exhibition.</p> <p>My final learning point from the last term is to start earlier! Once I have an idea I just need to get going instead of spending so much time in the planning phase. When I took art classes I found this kind of exploration coming more naturally to me. My former sculpture teacher would always say \"work makes work\". When studying design there has typically been more research and planning but sometimes I can get stuck there. I would like to find a balance between the two disciplines. Overall I am very excited to start working exploring my new weak signals, learning new tools to interface with the world, and researching new concepts to help me communicate my ideas more clearly.</p>"},{"location":"term02/designstudio2/#next-interventions","title":"Next Interventions","text":"<p>My first interventions will be related to exploring soil ecologies as mentioned above.

The first part of this intervention took place over the course of a month. The microbes were collected from 6 different locations in Collserola Natural Park, one of the few old growth forests left in the area. The collection of these indigenous microorganisms were done according to the JADAM Korean natural farming methods. Cooked rice was left in a breathable, in my case cardboard, box for a couple weeks each time. I placed the boxes next to the soul under old growth trees and covered them with a layer of leaf mould. The rice invites a diverse collection of soil microbes to grow. This inoculated rice is taken back to the lab and the microbes are put into a dormant state by adding equal parts by weight of brown sugar. This completes the first step in the method of making \u201cIMO 2\u201d, Indigenous Microorganisms. </p> <p> </p> <p>The most meaningful thing I was able to take away from this was my learnings about communities through observing microbes and their relationships to plants. The diverse community of microorganisms supports the plants that are growing in the soil. I think the intervention with microbes sheds light on the resilience of a diverse community. We often think of plants as stand-alone entities that only need food, water and sun to survive. Plants, like humans, are supported by a complex system of energy and nutrient flows enabling a biodiverse collection of microbes. Our understanding when we talk about microbes is \u201cgood bacteria\u201d vs \u201cbad bacteria\u201d but the truth is that it is more a complex web of biodiversity that keeps a system resilient and healthy. I think the knowledge we can learn from microbial communities that support life can be scaled up to the type of communities we need to nurture and encourage to bloom around us.  </p>"},{"location":"term02/designstudio2/#the-growing-of-a-citrus-tree","title":"The Growing of a Citrus Tree","text":"<p>The next intervention involved the collective care of some citrus trees my friend, Kelly, is taking care of for me back in Virginia.

This function generates synthesized square waves. </p> <p>I am interested in making a version of this paper synthesizer eventually. I wanted to see if I could make my own ribbon potentiometer instead of buying the soft potentiometer that they suggest. I found a couple resources online that I have linked below in references.

I had another issue of it being jumpy and playing multiple notes when it was touched. I solved that by smoothing the analog input from the sensor. I had some problems getting it right and kept getting an error. I went and asked ChatGPT to help me figure out where I was going wrong and I got a great answer!

For this challenge, I teamed up with Myrto and Seher. We come from different professional backgrounds, and it took us a while to think of an idea that would align with all of our research interests. Eventually, we settled on the question: what if we could store data inside the objects we use in our daily life?</p> <p>We were inspired to explore the concept of measuring from a hyper-personal perspective in a post-scientific way. We asked each other questions, such as when does measuring stop facilitating and start preventing a process? Are the usual measuring units contrary to replicability? Why do we measure things? Is it to save time instead of doing everything by trial and error, or for capitalism and control outcome prediction? We also wanted to explore other fields, such as storytelling and the strict binary distinction between the \"positive\" and \"negative\" of molds and objects.</p> <p>We began designing a tool that could encode audio messages onto the surface of everyday objects. This machine would be able to take audio input in real time, process it, and emboss it onto a ceramic cup, similar to how sound can be recorded onto a vinyl record. The messages will be engraved onto ceramics, and cups, pots, and other objects will become carriers of our stories that will travel through time. It is a concept that deals with continuity and archiving.</p> <p>We knew this would be an ambitious artifact to make, and we most likely wouldn't be able to complete it in the four days of the first micro challenge. We planned to make the first iteration of the prototype this week, which consists of a motorized turntable and an arm that could move up and down and hold different toolheads such as a pen. This first iteration was designed to write on a paper cup and test out our idea. We hope to make improvements to the design in subsequent micro challenge weeks.</p> <p>Although we come from different backgrounds, I think this allowed us to make a lot of progress in a short amount of time. Each of us had strengths that we were able to contribute to the group work this week. In the last few days, I spent a lot of time learning about how to program microcontrollers to control the two servo motors we needed for this prototype. I had never programmed a motor before, so this was all new to me. It was really fun, and I am looking forward to getting more into it in the coming weeks. My teammates focused on the design and fabrication of the turntable and started exploring the sound sensing piece of the project. We didn't have time to connect the sound input to the project, but we will be exploring that in the coming weeks. This week, we managed to build a simple and nice turntable and motorize it, as well as create a frame for the z-axis that will serve as an interchangeable toolhead for pens and carving tools.</p> <p>Check out the full project on our GitHub</p> <p>Andaaza by Seher, Myrto, &amp; Amanda</p>"},{"location":"term02/digitalprototyping/#references_4","title":"References","text":"<p>Using the Arduino AccelStepper Library</p> <p>AccelStepper Library</p> <p>Vinyl Record Cutting Lathe Fabacademy Project by Ambroise de Vries</p> <p>DIY Record Cutting Fabacademy project by David Robert</p>"},{"location":"term02/digitalprototyping/#networking","title":"Networking","text":"<p>In this class we learned about the foundations of the internet and how it works.

This app is great for objects with a flat bottom that could easily be capped off. Considering I scanned a black shoe on top of a black table I think it came out pretty well. There was also an odd hole in the toe that probably resulted from some sort of shadow in the shoe.

To make the loom more sturdy we added another support beam to the bottom to the bottom to make it more stable and to keep it from skewing under tension. We also created pockets for the heddle to sit down into to keep it from skewing from side to side like it would in the more open design.

I have delved into the potential of craft as a means to connect with the land and explore the natural world through the lens of technology. One of my key goals has been to draw parallels between cultivating microbial communities and fostering inclusive creative communities. By breaking down barriers between humans and non-humans, I aim to cultivate a holistic understanding of our surroundings and create spaces for introspection and connection.  </p> <p>As my journey progressed, my vision remained unwavering, but I began to refine my role within that vision. As a designer, I aspire to leverage my expertise and influence to amplify the voices of others, both human and non-human.

By imparting new skills and facilitating self-sufficiency, I aim to offer glimpses of alternative futures.  </p> <p>One significant realization I had was the importance of cultivating multigenerational creative spaces. There is immense value in learning from individuals who have deep connections to the land and possess diverse life experiences. While this may seem obvious, it is crucial to consciously include voices from all generations within these spaces. Furthermore, embracing the wisdom and perspectives of non-human collaborators adds richness and depth to our collective understanding.  </p> <p>I have also pondered the concept of makerspaces and the significance of prioritizing community and skills over physical space. A room filled with tools holds little meaning without the people who bring it to life.

However, as we continue to pursue knowledge and understanding, we realize that everything is much more complex than we originally thought.

The cloth is dyed with yams and iron rich mud from the river all with the help of the sun.</p> <p></p> <p>This cloth celebrates a long tradition in how it has been produced sustainably for 500 years. I find it interesting how we think a lot about sustainability in the future and at the same time so much can be learned from the past. This cloth is dyed with natural plant dye, mud, and the sun. The resulting fabric is one of the most beautiful textiles I own. It is the sort of think I will keep for the rest of my life. I can't always say that for most of the modern clothes I buy. There is something almost magical about the resulting cloth. It can't be replicated by manufacturing because then it wouldn't be what it is. It wouldn't be 500 years of handcrafted tradition. I do believe that we have to go back to an appreciation for handcraft over manufacturing. I believe the future is crafted and not manufactured. </p> <p>Something I find interesting is how a lot of culture, craft and traditions have been lost to time and colonialism and yet in a lot of academic settings there is this attitude of \"discovery\" as if these things are new. Things were done in circular and sustainable ways at one point before any institutions existed. It is the way of nature. The ability to craft things in a circular way is in our DNA. This is what still gives me hope. Seeing that materials like xiang yun sha still exist in the world give me hope. </p> <p>The Ziran Way Film from Ziran on Vimeo.</p> <p>Bombyx mori collaborative materials</p> <p>I have seen many projects where designers and artist collaborate with Bombyx mori (domesticated silkworms) to create a nonwoven silk material. Rather than spinning their cocoons the silkworms are coaxed to spin their silk strands across an armature. The silk resulting from the process is not woven in a traditional (human) way. It is pretty fine and transparent. Since it is nonwoven it might be difficult to turn it into a traditional cloth that can be cut and sewed. </p> <p>We had one of the more well known projects (Silk Pavillion) mentioned in class so I wanted to highlight the work of conceptual artist, Elsabe Dixon. She has been growing silkworms since her childhood in South Africa. I appreciate her approach to working with the silkworms as collaborators as she explores spiritual expression, labor and time. </p> <p> Alchemical Vessel - Elsabe Dixon 2014</p> <p> This is Labor - Elsabe Dixon 2013</p> <p>In traditional sericulture the silkworms are boiled alive to remove them from their cocoons. This allows the cocoons to be unwound in long strands. If the silkworms are allowed to complete their life-cycle they break through the cocoon and break up the long strand of silk. In the production of most silk the worms are killed to prevent them from breaking their cocoon. Silk threads can them be woven into cloth. I think it could be interesting for the non-woven silk mentioned above to be used in bioplastic composites to reinforce them. </p> <p>Bacterial Silk?</p> <p>If I could imagine a material I think it would be interesting to make silk from bacteria. Bacteria could be engineered to produce long fibers of silk-like proteins that can be spun into very fine threads. </p> <p>When textiles are dyed at an industrial scale a lot of water is used. There are many chemicals used in this process that make their way into polluting local ecosystems as well. The bacteria could also be engineered to produce pigment that could \"dye\" the fibers as they are being produced. This could potentially cut down on the amount water and energy needed to produce and dye a protein based silk-like fiber. The resulting pre-colored yarns could be woven with traditional techniques or knitting that take advantage of pre-dyed yarns. Examples of these weaving techniques can range from what you can see in jacquard or denim (twill). </p> <p></p>"},{"location":"term02/remixingmaterials/#materials-exploration","title":"Materials Exploration","text":"<p>For these weeks I was collaborating with Carolina. After the lectures we were most interested in experimenting with extracting colors from food waste and learning more about structural colors.

I noticed that it had a diffraction grating texture that might be copied by casting the bioplastic on top. I had experimented with these sorts of surfaces previously in 3D printing and then later in Fabricademy during our biomaterial week. We chose to work mainly with a gelatin bioplastic base to work with because it has less shrinkage and might copy the surface the best. The first batch was clear and it was easy to peel off after two days. </p> <p>For the next batch we boiled the coffee grounds the extract the color. We filtered the coffee grounds from the water and used the resulting coffee water to replace some of the water in the gelatin recipe. We followed the same method as before.

My collaborator, Carolina, would like to explore making biologically active \"graffiti\" that can be placed in urban areas. We are hoping to be able to laser cut gelatin filled with chia seeds and adhere it to different surfaces to see if it can grow.

Which residues?</p> <p>We acquired some coffee grounds from Itnig nearby. While it seems like it simply comes from next door the answer to \"Where does coffee come from?\" is centuries long. Most are familiar with the coffee ground waste after the coffee is brewed and enjoyed. The waste contains at least water, cellulose, and even residual caffeine. In addition to the grounds there is more waste generated in the production of coffee. In the production of coffee there is agricultural waste from the fruits called chaff.  When the coffee is roasted there are hulls removed during the process that is also waste. Ultimately the coffee shop brewing the coffee has coffee grounds as a waste product. </p> <p>What is the story behind?</p> <p>Ethiopia is known as the birthplace of coffee and first written accounts of it being consumed as a beverage were in Yemen in the 15th century (Wikipedia). Europeans discovered coffee as a beverage in the 17th century. In present day can only be gown in an area know as the \"Coffee Belt\" between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. All the coffee consumed in North American and Europe are imported from these regions in the coffee belt. </p> <p>Why is the material interesting from an environmental, social and economic point of view</p> <p>It touches many hands in almost every corner of the world from production to consumption. Coffee is political and sustainability has to be intersectional. We think there is a lot more work to be done beyond creating materials from waste in order to make coffee truly circular. Currently many agricultural workers, including children, who work with coffee are paid less than minimum wage. Only a small fraction of what we pay for our coffee makes it to back to the farmers.</p> <p>Why does your material fit in a circular economy?</p> <p>It does not yet. As long as we are extracting large amounts of agricultural products from the global south and not restoring the soils we are contributing to land degradation. We need to close the loop on the soil and lands where our foods are produced. Recycling the waste is only one small part of the work we need to do.</p> <p>Mention 5 possible applications where your material could be applied</p> <p>Applications that reflect Honorable Harvest principles.</p> <p>Coffee in the use of producing natural and organic fertilizers to enrich the soils where they were grown.</p> <p>Using waste coffee grounds for a natural pigment to dye clothing. Pigments and inks for coloring biomaterials and for use in Biograffiti</p> <p>Using spent coffee waste as a substrate to grow mushrooms. Close the loop by adding spent mushroom substrate back into the soils where the coffee was grown.</p> <p>Used as a source of cellulose to make bioleather.</p> <p>How does it makes you feel?</p> <p>Alive! Focused. Alert. Warmth.</p> <p>Is the elaborating process of your material similar to existing industrial processes? Which ones?</p> <p>It seems like the gelatin bioplastic can be cast into films and sheets which is possibly how the vinyl film that we copied was made. </p> <p>How the material can be manipulated? e.g. seal, sew, assemble, drill, self adhesive, etc.</p> <p>It can easily be cast onto a surface to copy the texture. It also can easily be punched, cut with scissors, and laser cut. It also gets sticky when it is wet and can be applied to smooth vertical surfaces like glass. </p> <p>Where it goes after disposal?</p> <p>Ultimately we would love to see the loop closed on the nutrients being depleted from the soils where coffee is grown. If the coffee wastes could be turned into fertilizers to enrich the soils where they would be grown that would be ideal.

This platform allows artisans, makers, and small business owners to set up their own community based micro-markets based on interests and affinity groups. Each marketplace is governed by its own unique community cooperative. The platform provides a template as a jumping off point for and structure for listing items and collecting payments.  </p> <p>Within these affinity groups artists can make their own collectives which allows them to share a storefront.

It also is a platform where users can make what they want of it, and where niche interests and communities can be found. Etsy as a marketplace for handmade goods and vintage finds is also unique in their user base and makes it accessible for anyone to find a specific item.  </p> <p>For our platform, there are other ideas we would like to incorporate. One would be a place where people could post specific artist or designer needs for a task. This is great as a way to connect artists with customers in a customized and personalized way. It also allows for another stream of revenue for makers. Another idea would be an online flea market where people could stumble or discover artists, makers, and designers as you do when you are walking around a market. This could either be a permanent portion of the platform or designated times of the year.  </p> <p>Overall we want a platform that supports the makers and artists first.

Going into this class I only thought of Blender as a 3D modeling program but after this I realized that it can be used to do so many things. One of the things I actually found very interesting was the history of Blender as a company. We learned about how they use an open source GNU GPL license that allows users to use Blender for free for any purpose, distribute freely, study how it works, and distribute changed versions with an obligation to publish those changes to keep it free and open. This free and open source model has kept Blender sustained since 1994. This is refreshing to me coming from an American perspective because in the business world I never heard much support for open source types of intellectual property and related business models. Blender has been able to sustain themselves for nearly 30 years as a non-profit due to their devoted community. The users own the software fully and new features developed are available to everyone. Over the years they have developed the platform to include tools for 3D modeling, sculpting, animation, UV mapping, rendering, and video editing.  </p> <p>It always amazes me what people can build when we don't have to worry about profits. I have heard people argue that making intellectual property closed, patentable, etc allows for more innovation. Blender is a great example on how open software and community can build amazing things without the need for profits. Ultimately the biggest takeaway for me this week was the open and free business model. I will definitely be revisiting that part of it in the future if I am thinking about business models.  </p>"},{"location":"term03/digitalprototyping/#live-coding-as-a-human-interface","title":"Live Coding as a Human Interface","text":"<p>In our course, we had the privilege of listening to Citlali Hernandez's captivating presentation on interaction design, electronics, and embodiment. I was genuinely thrilled to hear about her work, as it resonated strongly with my own interests. One aspect that particularly fascinated me was her journey in designing wearables for performers. Initially, Citlali didn't wear the creations herself, but she soon realized the value of testing them personally and actively participating in the performances. This shift significantly impacted her work. Similarly, I have been involved in designing wearables for performers, but I have not explored the personal aspect of wearing and testing them. Inspired by Citlali's experience, I now feel compelled to engage more intimately with the process of creating these wearables in the future. Although I have been hesitant to express myself as a performer in the past, I am now more open to exploring this avenue.</p> <p>Following the presentation, Citlali introduced us to the world of Live Coding, a captivating practice where individuals program visualizations and music on the fly, often as part of live performances. She shared insights about the local and international communities of artists who have formed around these events, primarily focused on electronic music. In class, we had the opportunity to experiment with a platform called Hydra, developed by Olivia Jack. Hydra is a live coding video synth that enables users to create animations directly in the browser. It provides seamless integration of audio and video inputs and outputs, and its user-friendly interface makes it accessible for beginners.

By taking a look at coding shapes in Python with Blender we got a better understanding on how it all works under the normal interface of Blender. It is interesting to see yet another way that Blender could be used. I have had some experience using Python in Grasshopper/Rhino to generate shapes so this reminded me of that as well. For me creating shapes this way is a bit tedious because I am not that great at coding yet but I definitely can see the potential to be able to hook this up the Arduino and other electronics. I am looking forward to having some more time in the future to experiment further with connecting my Ardunio and some sensors to Blender as well.  </p>"},{"location":"term03/digitalprototyping/#final-micro-challenge-intellectual-property","title":"Final Micro-challenge: Intellectual Property","text":"<p>For this final challenge Seher and I continued working on the project we had been working on in previous microchallenges.
